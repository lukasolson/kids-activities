# kids-activities

A simple little utility to keep kids occupied.

When your kid comes up to you and says, "I'm bored," you have a choice. You can start listing off activities for them to do. They will say no to everything you suggest, saying, "That's boring." Instead, if you let a computer randomly assign them an activity, they will be excited to do whatever they're assigned.
